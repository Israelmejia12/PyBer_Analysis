# PyBer_Analysis
Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.
The purpose of our analysis is to create a dataframe that shows the ride sharing data of the city types such as, rural,urban and suburban.
Through the power of pivot tables and graphs we will show total number of drivers,rides and fares by the type of cities. After we find our expectd results, we will also find average fare per ride as well as the driver's fare per ride.

Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.


Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
