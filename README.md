# PyBer_Analysis
##Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.
###The purpose of our analysis is to create a dataframe that shows the ride sharing data of the city types such as, ###rural,urban and suburban.
###Through the power of pivot tables and graphs we will show total number of drivers,rides and fares by the type of ###cities. After we find our expectd results, we will also find average fare per ride as well as the driver's fare ###per ride.

##Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
Through this summary of Dataframe we can see and small sample of what we are dealing with in our data. such as the avarage fare per ride and driver.

In the following image we can dive into the data a littlebit further and only got the fare for the city types for specific dates.

And finaly through the graph we are able to see which how each city perfirm when we compare them with one another.

Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
After going three our data there are three recommandation for our CEO. Number one I would say that depending on the time of the year and on the city type it would be good to have the prices fluctuate. For example for rutal the rate of the rites we get seem to go down so to encorage people to drive with us maybe we can change the price or have some incentive that will get people to ride us rather than the competitation. Number Two I would invenst more time and money on the urban areas even though there are probably less rides and more costly for matiencence there is potential for growth in this areas of the country. Number three I would also give some form of bonus to the drivers depending on the number of rides they complete in a giving year.
